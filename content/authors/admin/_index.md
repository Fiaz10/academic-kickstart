I'm Fiaz, a senior Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant at the Quantitative BioImaging Laboratory, where I work under Prof. Baowei Fei. 
My research interests include computer aided diagnostics using deep learning, image-guided intrvention, and designing medical devices. 
Previously, I have worked under Prof. Robert Gregg at the Locomotor Control Systems Laboratory where I worked on projects involving advanced prosthesis and exoskeletons.

Besides my academic and research work, I am passionate about leadership and community service. I am currently serving as the president of IEEE UT Dallas Student Branch, the largest engineering organization on campus. I am also the Student Representative for IEEE Region 5 where I represent 90 student branches in 12 southwestern states. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, outdoor photography, experimenting with cooking, reading books, or watching Netflix.
